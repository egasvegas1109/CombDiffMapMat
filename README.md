# Combining materials based on diffuse maps
CombDiffMapMat is a script designed to combine materials that have the same diffuse maps.
* **Support for combining materials on multiple objects:** the script can be used on several objects at once.
* **Removing unused materials:** after combining the materials, there are "dummy materials" that the script allows you to delete.
